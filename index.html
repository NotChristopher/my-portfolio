                    It is primarily made with HTML and CSS with some JS in there to enhance user experience.
                    This was a fun website to make and you can view the live demo or the github repo by hovering over the thumbnail.

                <h2 class="project-headline">Movie React Website</h2>
                <p class="project-subtext">This is a ReactJs project which uses the The Movie Database.org API to display 
                    information about a specific movie. You can search for any movie and get a result. I also added a home page which will show the user the movies that are trending for the week.
                    It was made with ReactJs and Bootstrap. I learned a lot about how to make API requests and how to read API documentation.

                <p class="project-subtext">This is a fun Javascript web based game. IT was made with vanilla JS in order for me to better understand DOM manipulation.
                    The dice game was fun to develop as I built it from the designer's flow chart and design images. It was a good challenge to handle player states, temp score and overall score with Javascript..
                    All in all this was a unforgetable experience.You can view the live demo or the github repo by hovering over the thumbnail.

                <h2 class="project-headline">Autum Slots</h2>
                <p class="project-subtext">I built and designed this browser game by myself. It was a challenging project to build and a lot of research went into how to create a slot game.
                    It was the first time that I worked with audio as well and I also added features like mute. This took me 2 weeks from design to deployment and I have a lot of takeaways from it. 
                    If I could do anything different, I would optimize my algorithm and put more time into creating a smooth spinning animation. That being said, it still was a fun project.
