            <h2 id="heading">About Me</h2>
        <div class "About-txt">
        <p >I am a Self Taught frontend web developer and I am passionate about all things Javascript. I can build web applications using Javascript and ReactJs.
            I can help with backend development using Nodejs and mySQL. I have experience in building backend API's with these technologies and would consider myself more than adequate.            
            </p> 
        <p>
            I have a passion for web development but I enjoy reading, rowing and currently I am enjoying relearning C# and game development with Unity3d.
             I love coding and an ideal role for me is a Frontend role with loads of Javascript and UI/UX specialization.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I have prior experience in Sales and during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 I started learning web development
            and I have set myself A goal of getting a Full time developer job in 2022.
            In late 2021 I started an internship at an exciting start-up. I did ReactJs and NodeJS development on their platform but as of now it is still not live. You can view my github to see my contributions. 
            I ended up leaving before my 3 months were done. This was due to conflicting schedules for a volunteer position. During this period though I learned a lot. Especially about day to day operations and running it in a remote first company. I got promoted to Project Lead within my first month and ended up running the development team and moving us to SCRUM andI cleared up a direct path to communication to management. I also ended up being in charge of code reviewing, merging and resolving merge issues in github for the team.

        </p>
        <p>
            I am more than ready to jump into a full time role and show the world what I can do. I love learning and it has been the cornerstone of my journey.
             Each week I learn a new way to do things I have done multiple times before. 
            I love development and I know I can be an asset to any company and my goal would be to hit the ground running.
